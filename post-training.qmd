## Introduction: Why Post-Training Matters for Reasoning

Large language models like GPT-4 and Claude have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including writing, summarization, problem solving, and open-ended reasoning. These are examples of **foundation models**—large, general-purpose models trained on broad data at scale, designed to serve as flexible building blocks for many downstream applications. But their raw, pre-trained form is not sufficient for safe, reliable deployment.

The core limitation lies in how LLMs are initially trained. They don’t follow strict rules or formal logic. Instead, they learn from statistical patterns in massive text corpora. This makes them flexible and creative—but also means their reasoning can be inconsistent, misleading, or untrustworthy.

These models are typically optimized to predict the next word in a sentence—not to follow instructions, act ethically, or meet human expectations. This initial phase is called **pre-training**, and it focuses on token-level quality—generating the most likely next word given the prior context. But users care more about the quality of the entire response than just the next token.

This is where **post-training** comes in. It refines the model’s behavior to be helpful, safe, and aligned with human intent. Some compare pre-training to reading a vast amount of text, and post-training to learning how to apply that knowledge in a useful, trustworthy way.

Post-training typically involves two key stages:

- **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**: teaching the model to follow instructions and carry out tasks
- **Preference optimization**: aligning outputs with human feedback using methods like RLHF, DPO, or RLAIF

These techniques not only improve factual accuracy and safety, but also enhance the model’s ability to reason. And surprisingly, they require relatively little compute—InstructGPT, for example, used only 2% of its total compute budget for post-training.

While supervised and preference tuning are the core of post-training, it’s also important to consider **prompting techniques**. These methods—such as **zero-shot**, **few-shot**, and **chain-of-thought** prompting—don’t change the model’s weights but can steer its behavior at inference time. Prompting often delivers strong results without additional training, making it an essential part of real-world LLM deployment.

In the sections that follow, we’ll explore both post-training techniques and prompting strategies, and how they work together to transform general-purpose LLMs into dependable, aligned assistants.

## Prompting

### Zero-Shot and Few-Shot In-Context Learning

**Concept**: Use prompts to guide pretrained models without any gradient updates or finetuning.

- **Zero-shot prompting**: Ask a question or issue a command without examples.  
  Example: “Translate this sentence into French.”

- **Few-shot prompting**: Provide a few (input → output) examples to demonstrate the task.  
  Example: showing multiple sentiment labels before asking for one more.

- **In-context learning**: The model uses these patterns to perform the task, thanks to its massive training data and scale.

**Key Insight**: These capabilities emerge only in large-scale models (e.g., GPT-3 with 175B parameters). Creative prompting (e.g., “TL;DR”) can yield surprisingly strong performance.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Concept**: Improve model reasoning by encouraging step-by-step answers.

Example: “Let’s think step by step.”

- Enhances performance on arithmetic, logic puzzles, and commonsense reasoning tasks
- Works in both few-shot and zero-shot settings with the right phrasing

Why it works: CoT helps the model break complex reasoning into interpretable steps—an emergent behavior at larger model scales.

## Instruction Finetuning

**Concept:**  
Instruction finetuning is a supervised post-training technique that trains LLMs on curated (instruction, response) pairs. It adapts a pre-trained foundation model to follow natural language instructions across a broad range of tasks — even ones it hasn’t seen before. This process can also be targeted toward specific domains or tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or medical diagnosis, by updating model parameters on high-quality datasets.  

While instruction finetuning improves task performance and alignment, it poses challenges including **overfitting**, **high computational costs**, and **sensitivity to dataset biases**. Parameter-efficient variants such as **LoRA** and **adapters** address these issues by updating only a small subset of parameters, reducing compute and storage requirements. However, increased specialization may reduce generalization to out-of-domain tasks, creating a trade-off between specificity and versatility.

**Advantages:**  
- Improves zero- and few-shot task generalization  
- Increases consistency and alignment across varied prompts  
- Produces more helpful, structured, and controllable responses  
- Can be tailored for domain-specific performance gains  
- Parameter-efficient methods (e.g., LoRA, adapters) enable faster, cheaper adaptation

**Limitations:**  
- Requires significant effort to create high-quality, diverse instruction datasets  
- Evaluating open-ended instructions can be subjective  
- Human-generated data may introduce bias, inconsistency, or noise  
- Risk of overfitting to narrow domains  
- May reduce generalization to out-of-domain scenarios  

The following table summarizes supervised finetuning methods described in *LLM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Reasoning* by Komal Kumar∗, Tajamul Ashraf∗, Omkar Thawakar, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Mubarak Shah, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Phillip H.S. Torr, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, and Salman Khan.

| Finetuning Type | Goal & Common Use Cases | Benefits | Limitations |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Instruction Finetuning** | Train LLMs to follow diverse instructions (e.g., summarization, classification, QA, creative writing). Enables zero-/few-shot generalization across tasks. | Improves generalization and alignment; makes outputs more helpful and controllable. | Requires large, curated datasets; open-ended tasks are harder to evaluate; may reflect human bias. |
| **Dialogue (Multi-turn) Finetuning** | Enable coherent, context-aware multi-turn conversations for chatbots and digital assistants. | Improves coherence, context tracking, and conversational experience. | Can overfit to chattiness; needs large, high-quality multi-turn dialogue datasets. |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Finetuning** | Encourage step-by-step reasoning in math, logic puzzles, multi-hop QA. | Improves reasoning interpretability and multi-step accuracy. | Requires structured reasoning traces; limited to reasoning-style tasks. |
| **Domain-Specific Finetuning** | Adapt models for specialized fields (e.g., biomedicine, finance, legal, climate, code). | Improves accuracy and relevance in domain-specific applications. | Needs high-quality, domain-specific corpora; risk of reduced generality. |
| **Distillation-Based Finetuning** | Transfer capabilities from a large “teacher” model to a smaller “student” model. | Produces smaller, faster models with high performance; reduces compute cost. | May lose nuance or performance compared to teacher; quality depends on teacher data. |
| **Preference/Alignment SFT** | Train models on labeled or ranked preference data before RLHF or DPO stages. | Improves alignment with human values; reduces harmful or irrelevant outputs. | Limited by scope and quality of preference data; definitions of “desirable” can vary. |
| **Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT)** | Efficiently adapt models without updating all weights (e.g., LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning). | Resource-efficient; enables adaptation on limited hardware. | May underperform full finetuning; sensitive to hyperparameter choices. |



## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

**Concept**: Use reinforcement learning to align model behavior with human preferences.

### RLHF Pipeline:
1. Start with an instruction-tuned model  
2. Collect human preference comparisons (A > B)  
3. Train a reward model  
4. Use RL (e.g., PPO) to maximize reward while applying KL penalty to stay close to the base model

**RLHF Objective**:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{\hat{y} \sim p_{\theta}^{\text{RL}}} \left[ R(x, \hat{y}) - \beta \log \frac{p_{\theta}^{\text{RL}}(\hat{y}|x)}{p_{\text{PT}}(\hat{y}|x)} \right]
$$

**Challenges**:
- Expensive and tricky to tune
- Can lead to overfitting the reward model (reward hacking)
- Still dependent on noisy human preferences

## Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

**Concept**: Simplified alternative to RLHF using only likelihood ratios to encode preferences directly into the model.

### DPO Loss:

$$
J_{\text{DPO}}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l)} \log \sigma \left( R_{\theta}(x, y_w) - R_{\theta}(x, y_l) \right)
$$

- No need for a separate reward model or PPO
- No online sampling
- Very stable and scalable

**Adoption**:
- Open-source LLMs like OpenChat and LLaMA variants now commonly use DPO

## Limitations and What’s Next

### Challenges with RLHF and DPO:
- Human feedback is noisy, inconsistent, and often biased
- Reward models are imperfect and can be overoptimized
- Risk of hallucination remains
- Human labelers may not reflect the preferences or safety standards of all users

### Emerging Techniques:
- RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF): Replace human labelers with AI critics
- Self-Taught Reasoning (STaR): Train on the model’s own reasoning traces
- Constitutional AI: Models self-critique and revise responses using ethical rules
- Personalization: Tailor outputs to user-specific preferences
