## Introduction

In the world of generative models, techniques like VAEs, GANs, and normalizing flows have each carved out their niche—but all of them come with specific constraints. **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)** offer a powerful alternative that’s **architecturally flexible**, **conceptually elegant**, and **growing in popularity** in modern deep learning research.

## Limitations of Mainstream Generative Models

| Model                   | Pros                                    | Cons                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VAEs**               | Probabilistic framework, tractable ELBO | Model architecture restrictions; blurry samples                     |
| **Normalizing Flows**  | Exact likelihood, invertibility          | Restricted to invertible architectures; expensive Jacobian computation |
| **Autoregressive Models** | Exact likelihood                    | Slow sampling; autoregressive dependency limits parallelism         |
| **GANs**               | High-quality samples; flexible           | No likelihood; unstable training; mode collapse                     |

These models attempt to approximate the true data distribution $P_{\text{data}}$ by selecting a model $P_\theta$ from a constrained family, often limited by the need for tractable likelihoods, invertible mappings, or adversarial training stability.

To understand how Energy-Based Models overcome many of these limitations, we first need to revisit a fundamental question in generative modeling: **what makes a valid probability distribution?**

The next section walks through the mathematical foundation that underpins EBMs — and introduces a clever trick that allows them to sidestep many of the constraints faced by traditional generative models.

## Math Review

### Understanding the Probability Foundation Behind EBMs

In generative modeling, a valid probability distribution $p(x)$ must satisfy:

- **Non-negativity**:  
  $$
  p(x) \geq 0
  $$

- **Normalization**:  
  $$
  \int p(x)\, dx = 1
  $$

While it’s easy to define a function that satisfies $p(x) \geq 0$ (e.g., using exponentials), ensuring that it also sums to 1 — i.e., $\int p(x)\, dx = 1$ — is much more difficult, especially for flexible functions like neural networks.

---

### Why do we introduce $g(x)$?

Instead of modeling $p(x)$ directly, we define a non-negative function $g(x) \geq 0$ and turn it into a probability distribution by normalizing:

$$
p_\theta(x) = \frac{g_\theta(x)}{Z(\theta)}, \quad \text{where} \quad Z(\theta) = \int g_\theta(x)\, dx
$$

This trick simplifies the problem by separating the two requirements:

- $g_\theta(x)$ ensures non-negativity  
- $Z(\theta)$ enforces normalization

This normalization constant $Z(\theta)$ is also known as the **partition function**.

---

### Intuition

Think of $g_\theta(x)$ as a scoring function:

- Higher $g_\theta(x)$ means more likely  
- Dividing by $Z(\theta)$ rescales these scores to form a valid probability distribution

---

### From Scores to Probabilities in EBMs

Energy-Based Models follow the same idea we've established earlier: define a **scoring function** $f_\theta(x)$ that assigns high values to likely data points, and then convert these scores into probabilities using an exponential transformation and normalization.  
This allows us to build flexible probabilistic models without needing tractable likelihoods or invertible mappings.

We use an **exponential function** because:

- It guarantees non-negativity: $\exp(f_\theta(x)) \geq 0$
- It allows us to interpret $f_\theta(x)$ as an unnormalized log-probability
- It connects naturally to many well-known distributions (e.g., exponential family, Boltzmann distribution)

We define:

$$
g_\theta(x) = \exp(f_\theta(x)) \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_\theta(x) = \frac{e^{f_\theta(x)}}{Z(\theta)}
$$

To align with the physics intuition that lower energy = higher probability, we define the **energy function** as:

$$
E_\theta(x) = -f_\theta(x)
$$

This gives us the classic EBM form:

$$
p_\theta(x) = \frac{e^{-E_\theta(x)}}{Z(\theta)}
$$

This formulation gives EBMs the freedom to use any differentiable function for $f_\theta(x)$, and only requires that we can compute or approximate its gradients.

--- 

### Practical Applications: When You Don’t Need $Z(\theta)$

In general, evaluating the full probability $p_\theta(x)$ requires computing the partition function $Z(\theta)$:

$$
p_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\theta)} \exp(f_\theta(x))
$$

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**Key Insight**  
In some applications, we don’t need the exact probability — we only need to compare scores.  
This allows EBMs to be useful even when the partition function is intractable.
:::

When comparing two samples $x$ and $x'$, we can compute the ratio of their probabilities:

$$
\frac{p_\theta(x)}{p_\theta(x')} = \exp(f_\theta(x) - f_\theta(x'))
$$

This lets us determine which input is more likely — without ever computing $Z(\theta)$ — a powerful advantage of EBMs.

**Practical Applications**:

- **Anomaly detection**: Identify inputs with unusually low likelihood.
- **Denoising**: Prefer cleaner versions of corrupted data by comparing likelihoods.

---

### Key Benefits of EBMs

**Very flexible model architectures**  
No need for invertibility, autoregressive factorization, or adversarial design.

**Stable training**  
Compared to GANs, EBMs can be more robust and easier to optimize.

**High sample quality**  
Capable of modeling complex, multi-modal data distributions.

**Flexible composition**  
Energies can be combined to support multi-task objectives or structured learning.

---

### Limitations of EBMs

Despite their strengths, EBMs come with notable challenges:

**Hard Sampling**

- No direct way to draw samples from $p_\theta(x)$  
- Requires iterative MCMC methods (e.g., Langevin dynamics, Metropolis-Hastings)  
- Sampling cost is high and scales poorly in high dimensions

**Hard Likelihood Evaluation and Learning**

- Partition function $Z(\theta)$ is intractable to compute  
- Cannot evaluate $\log p_\theta(x)$ directly  
- Learning requires **pushing down energy of incorrect samples**, not just increasing energy of training data

**No Feature Learning (by default)**

- EBMs do not learn latent representations unless explicitly modeled (e.g., using RBMs or structured latent energy functions)

---

## Training and Inference in EBMs

The goal in training Energy-Based Models (EBMs) is to assign higher scores (i.e., lower energy) to correct examples, and lower scores (higher energy) to incorrect ones. This corresponds to **maximizing the (unnormalized) likelihood** of the training data:

$$
p_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) = \frac{\exp(f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}))}{Z(\theta)}
$$

This expression tells us that increasing the score for $x_{\text{train}}$ is not enough — we must also decrease scores for other $x$ to reduce $Z(\theta)$ and make the probability higher **relatively**.

---

### Log-Likelihood and Its Gradient

We start by writing the log-likelihood:

$$
\log p_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) = f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - \log Z(\theta)
$$

Taking the gradient with respect to $\theta$:

$$
\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) = \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - \nabla_\theta \log Z(\theta)
$$

To compute this, we need the gradient of the log partition function:

$$
Z(\theta) = \int \exp(f_\theta(x))\, dx
$$

Applying the chain rule:

$$
\nabla_\theta \log Z(\theta)
= \frac{1}{Z(\theta)} \int \exp(f_\theta(x)) \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x)\, dx
= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\theta} \left[ \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x) \right]
$$

Substitute this back:

$$
\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x_{\text{train}})
= \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\theta} \left[ \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x) \right]
$$

The first term is straightforward — it's the gradient of the model's score on the training point.

But the second term, the **expectation over model samples**, is difficult. It requires drawing samples from $p_\theta(x)$, which in turn depends on the intractable normalization constant $Z(\theta)$.

To deal with this, we use **sampling-based approximations** like Contrastive Divergence.

---

### Contrastive Divergence

We approximate the expectation:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_\theta} \left[ \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x) \right] \approx \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{sample}})
$$

This gives:

$$
\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) \approx \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - \nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{sample}})
= \nabla_\theta \left( f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - f_\theta(x_{\text{sample}}) \right)
$$

**Contrastive Divergence Algorithm:**

1. Sample $x_{\text{sample}} \sim p_\theta$ (typically via MCMC)
2. Take a gradient step on:

$$
\nabla_\theta \left( f_\theta(x_{\text{train}}) - f_\theta(x_{\text{sample}}) \right)
$$

This encourages the model to increase the score of the training sample and decrease the score of samples it currently believes are likely.

**EBM Training Recap**  
- Want: High scores (low energy) for real data  
- Avoid: High scores for incorrect data  
- Can’t compute exact gradient due to $Z(\theta)$  
- So: Approximate using Monte Carlo sample $\sim p_\theta(x)$
:::

### Intuition Recap

- **Pull up** the training sample: $\nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{train}})$
- **Push down** samples from the model: $\nabla_\theta f_\theta(x_{\text{sample}})$
- The model improves by sharpening its belief in real data and correcting mistaken high-scoring areas of the space.

### Sampling from Energy-Based Models

Recall that EBMs define a probability distribution as:

$$
p_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\theta)} \exp(f_\theta(x))
$$

Unlike autoregressive or flow models, there is **no direct way to sample** from $p_\theta(x)$ because we cannot easily compute how likely each possible sample is. That's because the normalization term $Z(\theta)$ is intractable.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**Key Insight**  
We can still compare two samples $x$ and $x'$ without needing $Z(\theta)$:

$$
\frac{p_\theta(x)}{p_\theta(x')} = \exp(f_\theta(x) - f_\theta(x'))
$$

This property is useful for tasks like ranking, anomaly detection, and denoising.
:::

While we can't sample from $p_\theta(x)$ directly due to the intractable $Z(\theta)$, we can still generate approximate samples using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods.

---

### 1. Metropolis-Hastings (MH) MCMC

To sample from $p_\theta(x)$, we use an iterative approach like MCMC:

1. **Initialize** $x^0$ randomly  
2. **Propose** a new sample: $x' = x^t + \text{noise}$  
3. **Accept or reject** based on scores:
   - If $f_\theta(x') > f_\theta(x^t)$, set $x^{t+1} = x'$
   - Else set $x^{t+1} = x'$ with probability $\exp(f_\theta(x') - f_\theta(x^t))$
   - Otherwise, set $x^{t+1} = x^t$
4. **Repeat** this process until the chain converges

**Pros:**  
- General-purpose  
- Guaranteed to converge to $p_\theta(x)$ under mild conditions

**Cons:**  
- Can take a very long time to convergence 
- Sensitive to proposal distribution  
- Computationally expensive in high dimensions


### 2. Unadjusted Langevin MCMC (ULA)

To sample from $p_\theta(x)$, Unadjusted Langevin MCMC uses gradient information to guide proposals:

1. **Initialize** $x^0 \sim \pi(x)$  
2. **Repeat** for $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T - 1$:  
   - Sample $z^t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  
   - Update: $x^{t+1} = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x \log p_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t$  
3. **For EBMs**, since $\nabla_x \log p_\theta(x) = \nabla_x f_\theta(x)$:  
   - Update becomes: $x^{t+1} = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x f_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t$

**Pros:**  
- Uses gradient to improve proposal  
- Often faster mixing than random-walk methods  

**Cons:**  
- Still requires many steps for good convergence  
- Sensitive to step size $\epsilon$


### 2. Unadjusted Langevin MCMC (ULA)

To sample from $p_\theta(x)$, Unadjusted Langevin MCMC uses gradient information to guide proposals:

1. **Initialize** $x^0 \sim \pi(x)$  
2. **Repeat** for $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T - 1$:  
   - Sample noise:  
     $$
     z^t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
     $$
   - Update proposal:  
     $$
     x^{t+1} = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x \log p_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t
     $$

3. **For EBMs**, since  
   $$
   \nabla_x \log p_\theta(x) = \nabla_x f_\theta(x)
   $$  
   - Proposal becomes:  
     $$
     x^{t+1} = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x f_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t
     $$

**Pros:**  
- Uses gradient to improve proposal  
- Often faster mixing than random-walk methods  

**Cons:**  
- Still requires many steps for good convergence  
- Sensitive to step size $\epsilon$


### 3. Adjusted Langevin MCMC (ALA)

To sample from $p_\theta(x)$, Adjusted Langevin MCMC applies a **Metropolis-Hastings correction** step after each Langevin update to ensure samples follow the correct stationary distribution.

This makes it a **theoretically sound** version of ULA.

1. **Initialize** $x^0 \sim \pi(x)$  
2. **Repeat** for $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T - 1$:  
   - Sample $z^t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$  
   - Propose: $x' = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x \log p_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t$  
   - Accept or reject:  
     - With probability $\alpha = \min\left(1, \frac{p_\theta(x') \cdot q(x^t \mid x')}{p_\theta(x^t) \cdot q(x' \mid x^t)}\right)$, set $x^{t+1} = x'$  
     - Otherwise, set $x^{t+1} = x^t$  
3. **For EBMs**, since $\nabla_x \log p_\theta(x) = \nabla_x f_\theta(x)$ and  
   $q(x' \mid x^t) = \mathcal{N}\left(x' \mid x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x f_\theta(x^t),\ 2\epsilon I\right)$:  
   - Proposal becomes: $x' = x^t + \epsilon \nabla_x f_\theta(x^t) + \sqrt{2\epsilon} z^t$

**Pros:**  
- Theoretically sound (has correct limiting distribution)  
- Can be more robust than ULA  

**Cons:**  
- More expensive per iteration due to rejection sampling  
- Slower in high-dimensional spaces  
---

### Summary

All these methods aim to sample from $p_\theta(x)$, but differ in how they explore the space:

- **MH** is simple but inefficient.
- **ULA** is gradient-guided but approximate.
- **Adjusted Langevin** corrects ULA with MH.
- **HMC** is powerful but computationally heavy.

Sampling is a core challenge in EBMs — especially because we need to sample during **every training step** when using contrastive divergence.
