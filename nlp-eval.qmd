## Introduction:

**What is NLP Evaluation?**

NLP evaluation measures how well language models actually work. It answers basic questions: Is this model good enough? Can we trust it with real users?

But here's the challenge—testing language models isn't like testing regular software. When code breaks, it's obvious. When a language model fails, it might write something that sounds perfect but is completely wrong. A model might be 92% accurate overall but fail every time it sees sarcasm. This is what makes NLP evaluation so tricky: we're measuring how well computers understand the messy, complex world of human language.

**Why It Matters Now More Than Ever**

In 2023 alone, we saw an AI chatbot fail to recognize suicide warning signs (leading to a death), lawyers submit fake AI-generated cases to courts, and Air Canada forced to honor a refund policy its bot invented. As Chip Huyen warns: "The more AI is used, the more opportunity there is for catastrophic failure."

**The paradox** — The smarter our models get, the harder they become to evaluate. It's easy to check a kid's math homework, but verifying if an AI's medical advice is accurate requires medical expertise. We need good evaluation to build better models, but we need expertise to do good evaluation.

**Two Types of Tasks, Two Different Challenges**

- **Closed-ended tasks** have clear right answers (Is this email spam? What's the sentiment?). We can use traditional metrics like accuracy and precision, but even these "simple" tasks suffer from shortcuts, dataset problems, and human labeling errors.

- **Open-ended tasks** have no single right answer (Write a summary, translate this text, answer this question). Traditional metrics completely fail here. Word-matching might say "Heck no!" is similar to "Heck yes!" because they share words.

**What's Ahead**

This overview covers how to evaluate both closed and open-ended tasks, why current methods fail and what's replacing them, major problems like contamination and bias, and practical solutions for real-world applications.

## Closed-Ended Tasks

Closed-ended tasks are characterized by a limited set of correct answers—often just one. This constraint enables automatic, objective evaluation and makes these tasks ideal for benchmarking.

While closed-ended tasks offer clear and objective evaluation metrics, they still present meaningful challenges in dataset construction, evaluation design, and metric selection. Their well-defined output space enables direct comparison across models, but can also obscure subtle model weaknesses—such as shortcut learning or reliance on spurious correlations.

> 💡 *These tasks often serve as building blocks for more complex NLP pipelines.*

These individual tasks can also be grouped into multi-task benchmarks that evaluate general language understanding across a range of closed-ended challenges. **SuperGLUE** is one of the most prominent such benchmarks.

### Multi-Task Benchmark: **SuperGLUE**

While the previous section outlined individual closed-ended tasks, real-world evaluation often demands a unified benchmark that spans multiple task types. **SuperGLUE** is a widely adopted **closed-ended multi-task benchmark** created to evaluate broad general language understanding. It builds on its predecessor (GLUE) with harder tasks, more robust metrics, and an emphasis on reasoning.

SuperGLUE combines a diverse set of tasks—ranging from entailment and coreference resolution to causal reasoning and word sense disambiguation—designed to holistically assess a model’s linguistic and reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions.

**Tasks in SuperGLUE:**

| Task          | Description                                               | Type                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **BoolQ**, **MultiRC** | Reading comprehension                              | QA / Inference              |
| **CB**, **RTE**        | Natural language inference                         | Entailment                  |
| **COPA**              | Causal reasoning (cause/effect)                    | Reasoning                   |
| **ReCoRD**            | Reading comprehension with commonsense reasoning  | QA / Commonsense            |
| **WiC**               | Word meaning in context                            | Word Sense Disambiguation   |
| **WSC**               | Coreference resolution                             | Coreference                 |

Together, these tasks go beyond surface-level prediction—testing abilities like logical reasoning, commonsense application, coreference tracking, and contextual understanding.

**Leaderboard Highlights (v2.0):**

To measure and compare model performance on SuperGLUE, an official leaderboard tracks results across all tasks using standardized metrics. The **v2.0 leaderboard** showcases today’s most advanced models—ranging from parameter-efficient **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** systems to massive transformer-based architectures—offering a clear snapshot of the state of the art in general language understanding.

- **Top models**: Vega v2, ST-MoE-32B, ERNIE, PaLM 540B, T5  
- **Metrics used**: Accuracy, F1 score, Exact Match, Gender Parity, etc.

The leaderboard emphasizes **balanced generalization**, rewarding models that perform consistently well across diverse task types—not just a few. This makes it a reliable benchmark for tracking progress toward broadly capable language models.


### Domain-Rich Multi-Task Benchmark: MMLU

While SuperGLUE focuses on general linguistic reasoning, **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** shifts the spotlight to **domain knowledge**. It has rapidly become the *de facto* benchmark for evaluating a model’s grasp of academic and professional subjects—effectively acting as a proxy for general intelligence in many LLM leaderboards.

**What is MMLU?**

- **57 subjects** spanning elementary math, anatomy, law, philosophy, computer science, US history, and more  
- **Multiple-choice format** (A, B, C, D), with ~100 questions per subject  
- **Balanced question design** that mimics real academic tests and professional licensing exams  
- **Closed-book evaluation** (no retrieval), testing what the model has internalized from pretraining  

MMLU has emerged as a **standardized benchmark** for evaluating foundational knowledge across domains. It allows for **direct accuracy-based comparisons** between models of different sizes and architectures. Performance gains have been dramatic—rising from ~**25% (random guessing)** to over **90% accuracy** in just four years.

> **Note**: MMLU is often treated as a shortcut for measuring "general intelligence," but that can be misleading. What it really tests is how well a model can recall facts and recognize patterns—not necessarily how well it can reason or think abstractly. We’ll explore these limitations later.

**MMLU in Modern LLM Leaderboards**

Modern LLMs—including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 3, and PaLM—routinely report MMLU scores as a primary metric. As with SuperGLUE, MMLU supports **multi-subject generalization**, but with a stronger emphasis on **world knowledge** rather than linguistic nuance.


**SuperGLUE vs MMLU: A Comparison**

| Aspect | **SuperGLUE** | **MMLU** |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Focus** | Language reasoning | Factual subject knowledge |
| **Format** | Varied NLP tasks | Multiple choice |
| **Tasks / Subjects** | 8 tasks | 57 subjects |
| **Primary Skill Tested** | Inference, disambiguation, coreference | Retained domain knowledge |
| **Metric** | Accuracy, F1, etc. | Accuracy only |

> While both are multi-task benchmarks, they evaluate very different capabilities—SuperGLUE emphasizes reasoning and understanding, whereas MMLU stresses factual recall across disciplines.


### Challenges in Closed-Ended Evaluation

1. **Choosing the Right Metric:** Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric is critical but non-trivial. Different tasks and dataset characteristics (e.g., class imbalance, label skew) demand different metrics. For instance, accuracy may look impressive but can be misleading in imbalanced datasets—it might just reflect majority-class predictions.

    Instead, precision and recall offer complementary views: precision focuses on correctness (fewer false positives), while recall emphasizes completeness (fewer false negatives).

    The choice of metric shapes how performance is interpreted, compared, and optimized. In multi-class or skewed settings, relying on a single metric may obscure weaknesses.

::: {.callout-note title="Quick Reference: Common Evaluation Metrics"}

- **Accuracy**: $(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)$  
  Best for balanced datasets with equal class distribution.

- **Precision**: $TP / (TP + FP)$  
  High precision means fewer false positives.

- **Recall**: $TP / (TP + FN)$  
  High recall means fewer false negatives.

- **F1 Score**: $2 \cdot (Precision \cdot Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$  
  Useful when you need a balance between precision and recall.

- **Exact Match (EM)**: Binary match with reference output.  
  Best for QA and structured prediction.

- **AUC-ROC**: Measures discrimination across thresholds.  
  Great for binary classification tasks.

2. **Aggregating Metrics:** In multi-task setups like SuperGLUE, metrics must be combined carefully. Simple averaging can hide poor performance on harder tasks or tasks with imbalanced label distributions.

3. **Label Quality:** Evaluation reliability depends on the consistency and accuracy of ground-truth labels. Poorly defined labels or subjective task setups can introduce ambiguity, reducing the quality of both training and evaluation signals.

4. **Spurious Correlations:** Models sometimes rely on patterns or artifacts in the data that don’t reflect real understanding. This can lead to seemingly correct answers based on shortcuts, not reasoning.

   - **Example** (SNLI):  
     - Premise: “The economy could be still better.”  
     - Hypothesis: “The economy has *never* been better.”  
     - Model might infer contradiction simply due to the word *never* rather than actual reasoning

This reveals how even in closed-ended tasks, evaluation must consider model behavior beyond raw accuracy to ensure generalization and robustness.

## Open-Ended Text Generation

Open-ended generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), are capable of producing free-form outputs like summaries, translations, stories, or answers to instructions. Unlike traditional models that produce a fixed label or number, these models generate entire sequences of text—often with multiple plausible responses for a single input.

This flexibility makes them powerful but also difficult to evaluate. There is rarely a single “correct” output, and even seemingly unrelated completions may still be valid. For example, a user prompt like *“Tell me something interesting about the moon”* could lead to many diverse, accurate, and coherent answers.

Evaluating such outputs requires more than checking against a reference—it demands assessing coherence, fluency, relevance, factual accuracy, and semantic alignment.

As a result, evaluation of open-ended generation must go beyond traditional metrics and adopt a more nuanced, multi-faceted approach.


### Types of Evaluation Methods

There are three broad classes of evaluation methods for text generation:

- **Content Overlap Metrics** – compare model outputs against human-written references based on lexical or n-gram overlap.
- **Model-Based Metrics** – assess semantic similarity using pretrained embedding models (e.g., BERTScore, BLEURT).
- **Human Evaluations** – involve direct human judgment of qualities such as fluency, coherence, and factual correctness.


**Content Overlap Metrics:**

These methods compute similarity based on surface-level word overlap between the generated text and a reference.

- Fast and widely used but limited in capturing meaning.
- Common metrics include **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, **METEOR**, **CIDEr**.
- Often reported for tasks like summarization and translation, despite known limitations.

> *n-gram metrics have no concept of meaning—they fail when different words express the same idea.*


**Model-Based Metrics**

These metrics leverage learned representations from pre-trained language models to evaluate **semantic similarity**.

- Compute similarity in embedding space between reference and generated outputs.
- More robust to paraphrasing and lexical variation.

Two popular types:

- **BERTScore**  
  - Uses contextual embeddings from BERT and cosine similarity to compare word pairs.  
  - Captures semantic relationships between words.  
  - *(Zhang et al., 2020)*

- **BLEURT**  
  - Fine-tuned regression model based on BERT.  
  - Outputs a score indicating grammar and meaning similarity with reference text.  
  - *(Sellam et al., 2020)*


**Human Evaluations**

Human evaluation remains the gold standard—especially for open-ended tasks.

- Captures subjective qualities like **fluency**, **coherence**, **factual accuracy**, and **harmlessness**.
- Can use Likert scales, pairwise comparisons, or ranking approaches.
- Important to run multiple annotators and test inter-annotator agreement.

Evaluation of factuality is particularly difficult. As the lecture notes emphasize, a model can produce highly fluent and confident outputs that are factually wrong. In tasks like summarization, this means comparing to source documents—not just a reference summary.


**Reference Quality Matters**

Evaluation scores are only as good as the reference they compare against.

- A flawed reference can mislead metrics like ROUGE or BLEU.
- Expert-written references lead to better correlation with human judgments of faithfulness.
- When references are missing, metrics break down—making human evaluation essential.
