## Introduction

The mainframe revolutionized transaction processing. The cloud enabled elastic scaling. Now AI is fundamentally changing what banks can automate.

The difference between **Generative AI** and **Agentic AI** is the difference between a tool that drafts an email and one that reads your inbox, prioritizes responses, and handles routine inquiries without supervision. Generative AI creates content. Agentic AI executes work.

Banks that are building agent-driven architectures will respond faster, serve customers better, and allocate capital more efficiently than competitors treating AI as an add-on.

To understand where banking AI is headed, we need to see how banking architecture evolved to support increasingly intelligent automation—and what makes the current moment different from past technology transitions.

## Technology Transitions in Banking Architecture

**1960s–2000s: From Mainframes to Services**

Banking technology evolved from centralized mainframe systems—where deposits, payments, and accounting lived in a single computing environment—to distributed architectures that separated customer channels from core processing. The internet brought online banking and digital access. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) broke monolithic systems into reusable components like KYC, payments, and fraud checks. By the early 2000s, banks had built the foundational separation between presentation, application logic, and data that modern systems still rely on.

**2010s: Cloud and API Ecosystems**

Cloud platforms introduced elastic scaling and microservices, allowing banks to build and deploy products faster. This era enabled open banking, partner integrations, and modern data platforms. More importantly, it established API-based connectivity as the standard way systems communicate—a prerequisite for agent-driven architectures.

**2022–Present: AI as Operating Infrastructure**

The emergence of large language models changed what banks can automate. Earlier AI handled narrow tasks like fraud scoring or chatbot responses. Today's systems combine language models with enterprise data to support complex decision-making and multi-step workflows.

Three architectural patterns define this shift:

- **Structured context**: Banks feed private data to AI models through governed pipelines rather than training custom models, allowing agents to work with proprietary information while maintaining control

- **Tool integration**: AI systems can now trigger actions across multiple platforms—reading documents, querying databases, initiating workflows—rather than just generating text responses

- **Semantic retrieval**: Vector databases allow agents to find relevant information based on meaning rather than keywords, making knowledge discovery faster and more accurate

This combination—language understanding plus structured data access plus action capabilities—is what enables AI agents to execute work rather than simply provide information.

## The Three Levels of Agents in Banking

AI agents differ by autonomy level. L1 agents provide intelligence, L2 agents execute processes, and L3 agents make decisions independently. Understanding these levels helps banks deploy agents appropriately—matching capability to risk tolerance and regulatory requirements.

**L1 – Insight Agents (Assistive Intelligence)**

L1 agents extract and synthesize information to support human decision-making. They assist with planning, discovery, and knowledge retrieval but do not take actions independently. Humans control all execution.

In banking, L1 agents appear most commonly in advisor tools and research summarization.

Morgan Stanley's AI @ Morgan Stanley Debrief tool automates meeting notes, analyzes client profiles and transaction histories, and generates tailored recommendations before advisor meetings. The tool saves approximately 30 minutes per meeting, freeing 10–15 hours per week for higher-value client work.

Morgan Stanley's AskResearchGPT synthesizes insights from over 70,000 proprietary research reports. Similar tools have reduced document review time by up to 90% while improving accuracy by 25%.


**L2 – Process Orchestration Agents (Semi-Autonomous)**

L2 agents execute multi-step, rule-governed business processes. They decompose tasks, orchestrate workflows across systems, and automate structured operations while operating under human supervision and regulatory controls.

Consider compliance documentation. Writing suspicious activity reports (SARs), regulatory memos, and audit summaries traditionally requires manual effort and creates consistency problems.

L2 agents automate classification, extraction, summarization, and drafting while enforcing compliance standards. These systems have cut turnaround time by 80% and improved processing accuracy, allowing compliance teams to handle higher volumes with better quality.

The key distinction from L1: these agents don't just provide recommendations—they generate final work products and execute regulated processes within defined guardrails.


**L3 – Complex Decisioning Agents (Fully Autonomous)**

L3 agents continuously monitor their environment, make decisions, and trigger actions without constant human involvement. They coordinate L1 and L2 agents to operate as closed-loop decision systems.

Rather than waiting for borrowers or advisors to identify refinancing opportunities, an L3 agent monitors market rates, borrower credit profiles, loan performance, and property valuations continuously. 

When conditions align, the agent triggers eligibility checks through L2 agents, generates personalized offers, initiates pre-approval workflows, and notifies customers and relationship managers. Work that traditionally requires weeks of coordination compresses into hours.

Because L3 agents act independently, they introduce operational and regulatory risk. Governance, auditability, and human override capabilities are fundamental requirements, not optional features.

> **Implementation Reality:** Most banks operate primarily at L1 today and are scaling L2 capabilities. L1 agents prepare intelligence, L2 agents execute regulated processes, and L3 agents make and act on decisions independently. Governed L3 use cases represent the next competitive frontier and the next major governance challenge.

## Experience Agents vs. Domain Agents

Beyond the L1/L2/L3 autonomy levels, agents also differ by who—or what—they interact with.

**Experience Agents** interact directly with people: customers, relationship managers, and operations staff. They handle conversations, provide recommendations, and guide users through tasks. These agents remember context from earlier in a session and personalize responses based on user history and intent. Think of chatbots, advisor copilots, and customer service assistants.

**Domain Agents** interact directly with systems: enterprise data, applications, and workflows. They execute backend processes such as validation, risk assessment, and transaction orchestration. These agents operate autonomously within defined business rules and execute core banking processes across credit, fraud, compliance, and operations. They work behind the scenes, often invisible to end users.

Experience agents must handle ambiguity and communicate clearly. Domain agents must execute with precision and maintain audit trails. In practice, most banking workflows combine both types—Experience agents at the front end capturing user needs, Domain agents in the back end executing the work.

## The Reference Architecture for an AI-First Bank

Now that we've defined agent types, where do they actually operate? An AI-first bank architecture is organized into six layers, each serving a distinct purpose. Experience Agents live in the customer-facing layer, Domain Agents execute work in the action layer, and the intelligence layer coordinates both.

**1: Customer Layer:** Web, mobile, contact centers, and advisor desktops make up the Customer Layer. Experience Agents operate here—the chatbots, copilots, and assistants that customers and bankers interact with directly. This layer handles identity, personalization, and real-time responsiveness.

**2: Action Layer:** The Action Layer executes core banking work: loan origination, payments, fraud checks, cash management, and servicing. Domain Agents orchestrate these processes, connecting multiple systems and enforcing business rules. What used to be rigid, sequential workflows become flexible, policy-governed sequences that adapt based on data and context.

**3: Intelligence Layer:** The Intelligence Layer coordinates all AI activity across the bank. It manages model deployment, monitors performance, controls access to data, and enforces risk boundaries. This is where L1, L2, and L3 agents are orchestrated—ensuring an insight agent pulling research doesn't access the same systems as a decisioning agent approving loans. The layer also handles prompt management, output validation, and model risk controls that regulators expect.

**4: Data Layer:** Agents need access to enterprise data—customer profiles, transaction histories, risk scores, and market data. The Data Layer provides this through traditional data warehouses and lakes, plus newer retrieval systems optimized for AI search. Rather than training separate models on private data, banks feed structured context to foundation models through governed pipelines. This approach maintains control while enabling agents to work with proprietary information.

**5: Foundational Layer:** Core banking systems—deposits, lending, payments, general ledger, and customer master data—anchor the Foundational Layer. These remain the authoritative source for balances, transactions, and financial positions. Agents read from and write to these systems but never replace them.

**6: Control Plane and Cloud Native Fabric:** Two elements cut across all layers. The Control Plane provides enterprise-wide security, governance, compliance, and auditability. The Cloud Native Fabric enables flexible deployment across on-premise and cloud environments. Together they ensure agents can innovate without compromising regulatory discipline or data protection.

This layered approach allows banks to experiment with AI in customer-facing applications while maintaining strict controls over core banking operations.

## Use Cases: Agents in Practice

The architecture comes to life through specific banking workflows. These four use cases demonstrate how Experience and Domain agents collaborate across retail, corporate, risk, and compliance functions.

### Retail Banking (Agent Collaboration)

**Scenario:** A customer interacts with her bank while a relationship manager oversees the account. Multiple Experience Agents and one Domain Agent work together.

**Customer experience:** A Spend Analyzer Agent tracks spending patterns. When the customer plans a major expense, a Product Recommendation Agent identifies a likely cash shortfall, suggests lending products, and creates a personalized repayment schedule based on income and expenses.

**Banker experience:** The relationship manager works through an AI-powered dashboard. An Application Tracker Agent summarizes the loan application by risk tier and approval probability. A Credit Decisioning Agent handles due diligence and issues automated approval within defined risk thresholds, routing exceptions to human credit officers.

**Outcome:** AI integrates into the customer's financial life while providing bankers with actionable, policy-compliant intelligence.

### Corporate Banking (Agent-to-Agent Automation)

**Scenario:** Supremo Corporation expands into Europe, requiring coordination between the corporate client and bank across multiple geographies.

**Forecasting:** The CFO uses a Cash Flow Forecasting Agent that consolidates data from Balance Inquiry Agents and Document Extraction Agents reading invoice data. Together they project a working capital shortfall. The client's agent then communicates directly with the bank's domain agents to request a €50 million credit facility.

**Agent-to-agent communication:** The client's agent communicates directly with the bank's domain agents to request a €50 million credit facility.

**Execution:** The bank's Risk Agent generates a credit write-up by analyzing financial statements, market conditions, and reports. Once approved, the Supply Chain Finance Smart Program Agent reads supplier contracts and automatically onboards European suppliers into the financing program.

All approvals and onboarding operate within regulatory, legal, and credit policy constraints, with automatic escalation to regional credit officers when cross-border risk thresholds are exceeded.

**Outcome:** Work that traditionally requires months of email exchanges and document reviews executes rapidly through interoperable domain agents.

### Risk Management (Stress Testing and CCAR)

**Scenario:** Regulatory stress testing and scenario analysis for CCAR compliance.

**The problem:** Preparing for regulatory stress tests traditionally requires months of data gathering, model execution, and scenario construction to answer questions like "What happens if interest rates rise by 2 percent?"

**The solution:** An AI Assistant retrieves Federal Reserve guidance and maps regulatory stress scenarios into calibrated baseline and adverse frameworks. A Stress Testing Domain Agent applies these scenarios to the bank's portfolio using enterprise calculation engines.

**Outcome:** The Chief Risk Officer reviews capital adequacy, liquidity impact, and profitability projections in one day rather than multiple months.

### Financial Crime (AI Investigator)

**Scenario:** Anti-money laundering alerts with high false-positive rates that traditionally require large investigation teams.

**The process:** The AI Investigator Agent reviews transaction alerts in real time, assigns a quantitative risk score (for example, 98.85), and generates a transparent narrative explaining suspicious behavior such as rapid fund movement or transaction structuring.

**Human oversight:** Investigators review the AI-generated narrative and visual fund flow diagrams rather than spending hours gathering evidence manually. They validate insights and mark cases as credible or non-credible, feeding this feedback into continuous model improvement.

**Outcome:** Work that previously required days of manual evidence gathering condenses into minutes, producing regulator-ready, auditable cases.

## Conclusion

The shift to Agentic AI is the defining characteristic of *Banking 4.0*. It enables banks to move beyond simply recording transactions toward actively orchestrating financial outcomes in real time. Yet trust remains the true currency of banking. As agents take on greater responsibility, the **Intelligence Layer**—which governs orchestration, hallucination controls, model risk management, and auditability—becomes the most critical piece of infrastructure in the modern bank. The institutions that win will be those that successfully combine the creative power of **large language models (LLMs)** in the front office with the **speed, privacy, and precision of small language models (SLMs)** in the back office—delivering innovation without compromising control.
