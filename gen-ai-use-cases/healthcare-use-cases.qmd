## Clinical Documentation

Generative AI is significantly reducing the administrative burden on clinicians by automating the creation of clinical notes and summaries. AI tools can transcribe doctor-patient conversations, extract relevant medical details, and generate structured notes in real time or post-visit.

- **Nuance DAX Copilot (Microsoft)**: Automatically generates clinical notes during consultations, reducing documentation time for physicians.  
- **AWS HealthScribe**: Extracts structured data and generates medical summaries from recorded conversations between patients and providers.

## Medical Imaging and Diagnostics

Generative models such as GANs and diffusion are being used to enhance medical images, synthesize missing views, and even generate realistic training data for rare conditions. These techniques improve diagnostic quality and accelerate model development.

- **Google DeepMind**: Uses generative models to enhance resolution in retinal scans and chest X-rays.  
- **MIT CSAIL**: Trains diagnostic AI systems using synthetic images generated via diffusion models, improving accuracy for rare diseases.

## Drug Discovery and Molecular Design

Pharmaceutical companies and AI research labs are using GenAI to generate novel molecular structures that satisfy biological and chemical constraints. This reduces the time and cost of early-stage drug discovery.

- **Insilico Medicine**: Uses generative chemistry platforms to propose new drug candidates and recently advanced one into Phase II trials.  
- **BenevolentAI**: Uses AI models to generate molecules with desired properties based on disease pathways and target proteins.

## Patient Communication and Education

Healthcare providers are using GenAI to generate personalized educational materials, explain complex medical conditions in plain language, and respond to patient questions through virtual assistants.

- **Mayo Clinic and Microsoft Copilot**: Exploring AI to generate patient-friendly summaries of lab results and discharge instructions.  
- **Ada Health**: Uses generative agents to guide patients through symptom checking and triage using everyday language.

## Administrative Workflow Automation

Hospitals and health systems are adopting GenAI to streamline operational processes such as prior authorization, billing, appeals, and scheduling. This improves staff productivity and reduces manual paperwork.

- **Google MedLM**: Supports automation of prior authorization workflows and claim denials through natural language understanding and document generation.  
- **Abridge**: Not only transcribes medical conversations, but also classifies, summarizes, and codes them for billing and documentation purposes.
