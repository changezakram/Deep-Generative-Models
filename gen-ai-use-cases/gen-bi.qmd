# Executive Summary

## What is Generative BI?

Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI) integrates large language models (LLMs) into business intelligence workflows, enabling users to interact with data through natural language queries (NLQ) and generate dynamic narratives (NLG). This shift moves BI from static dashboards and pre-defined filters to real-time, conversational insight delivery.

Unlike traditional BI tools that require technical skill to extract insights, Gen BI allows users to ask questions in plain English, automates reporting, and generates personalized summaries — all grounded in enterprise data.

## Why Now?

Three converging trends are accelerating the adoption of Gen BI:

- **LLM Maturity**: Advanced models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini now support complex reasoning and multilingual interaction.
- **Technology Convergence**: Modern data stacks (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Power BI) provide clean, governed data layers that LLMs can safely access.
- **Business Demand**: Organizations want faster, more intuitive access to insights without expanding BI teams.

According to Gartner, 40% of enterprise applications now include conversational AI, up from less than 5% in 2020<sup>[1]</sup>.

A 2024 McKinsey survey found that 65% of organizations use generative AI in at least one business function — nearly double the rate from the previous year<sup>[2]</sup>.

Recent trends support this shift: 67% of business leaders now report using generative AI specifically for data analysis and business intelligence<sup>[3]</sup>. This highlights growing recognition that BI must evolve from simply being accessible to being intelligent, adaptive, and proactive.

## Strategic Relevance for Our Organization

For data-driven organizations, Gen BI offers immediate strategic benefits:

- **Democratizes analytics**: Empowers non-technical users to access data independently
- **Automates narrative generation**: Saves analysts time with auto-generated summaries, KPI explanations, and board-ready briefs
- **Improves data literacy**: Translates structured data into business-friendly language
- **Boosts BI ROI**: Enhances the value of existing BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or ThoughtSpot without requiring replacement

McKinsey estimates that generative AI could contribute up to $4.4 trillion annually to global productivity gains<sup>[4]</sup>. Organizations that embed Gen BI early stand to gain a decisive advantage in decision velocity, efficiency, and user empowerment.

# Foundations of Generative BI

## From Traditional BI to Generative BI

Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) is centered around predefined reports, dashboards, and structured queries. Business users often depend on analysts to write SQL, prepare data models, or build dashboards — leading to bottlenecks and long turnaround times.

Self-service BI platforms like Power BI and Tableau introduced visual interfaces and drag-and-drop tools to reduce technical friction. However, even these tools require users to understand data schemas, relationships, and filters to get meaningful insights.

**Generative BI represents a major leap forward.** It allows users to interact with enterprise data using plain language, receive direct answers, and generate narrative summaries — powered by large language models (LLMs). This approach removes barriers to insight by making analytics conversational, contextual, and personalized.

## Key Capabilities of Gen BI

1. **Natural Language Querying (NLQ)**  
   Users can ask business questions like “What were sales last quarter by region?” and receive charted responses — no code or filters needed.

2. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**  
   Automated summaries explain what changed, why it matters, and what to watch next — saving time and making data actionable.

3. **Agent-Based Analysis**  
   Autonomous agents or copilots can proactively detect anomalies, generate executive reports, or monitor KPIs without needing explicit prompts.

These capabilities enable faster insight generation, broader adoption of analytics, and reduced dependence on BI developers.

## Distinction from Self-Service and Augmented Analytics

**Self-Service BI** allows business users to create their own reports and dashboards using drag-and-drop interfaces and visual tools — typically without writing code. It empowers users but still requires them to understand filters, dimensions, and data relationships.

**Augmented Analytics** builds on self-service BI by adding AI and machine learning to assist users with automated insights. These tools can suggest visualizations, detect anomalies, or highlight trends, but they still rely primarily on user-driven dashboard interaction.

Generative BI is the next step beyond self-service and augmented analytics. While it builds on the foundation they created, it introduces a new level of intelligence, automation, and ease of use — especially through natural language interaction.


| Capability                        | Self-Service BI | Augmented Analytics | Generative BI     |
|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Requires dashboard interaction   | Yes              | Sometimes            | No                 |
| Natural language interface       | Limited          | Intermediate         | Primary method     |
| AI-generated narratives          | Rare             | Sometimes            | Yes                |
| Proactive insight generation     | No               | Limited              | Yes (agents)       |
| Ease of use for business users   | Medium           | High                 | Very High          |

# Semantic Layer: The Bridge Between Data and Language

## What Is a Semantic Layer?

A **semantic layer** is a business-facing abstraction that translates complex data structures into familiar business terms like “net revenue,” “customer churn,” or “active users.” It allows users to interact with data intuitively, without needing to know database schemas, table joins, or SQL.

Rather than building logic repeatedly in dashboards or hardcoding KPIs, organizations define metrics and relationships once in the semantic layer — and reuse them across tools. This ensures consistency, reduces rework, and builds trust in data-driven decisions.

## Why It Matters in Generative BI

Generative BI platforms enable users to ask data questions in plain English. But without a semantic layer, large language models (LLMs) can misinterpret field names, generate incorrect queries, or return inconsistent results.

The semantic layer provides the **context, logic, and guardrails** that Gen BI systems need to generate accurate, explainable answers. It ensures that when someone asks, “What’s our revenue trend in the Northeast?”, the system can translate that prompt into governed, pre-defined business logic — not a guess.

In short, **the semantic layer is what makes natural language interaction trustworthy.**

## Core Benefits

| Capability              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Abstraction** | Allows users to query data using familiar business terms                    |
| **Metric Consistency**   | Ensures KPIs and calculations are defined and reused uniformly              |
| **Governance & Access**  | Applies role-based access controls, audit trails, and data lineage          |
| **Explainability**       | Provides transparency behind AI-generated answers and dashboards            |
| **Cross-Tool Reusability** | Enables shared definitions across BI tools and Gen AI interfaces          |

Below the surface, these benefits also support key strategic outcomes:

- **Governance**: Enforces access controls, ensures accurate metric logic, and prevents unauthorized joins  
- **Consistency**: Everyone calculates KPIs the same way — no more “multiple versions of the truth”  
- **Reusability**: Build once, reuse across Gen BI assistants, dashboards, and reports  
- **Efficiency**: Reduces analyst workload by removing ambiguity and duplication




## Architecture Approaches to Building a Semantic Layer

Not all semantic layers are built the same way. The architecture you choose can significantly affect flexibility, governance, and GenAI readiness. Based on a framework outlined by Kyligence[^1], there are three dominant approaches:

### In-Warehouse Semantic Layer  
Built directly within the data warehouse or lake (e.g., as SQL views or materialized metrics).

- ✅ **Pros**: No vendor lock-in, trusted by IT, close to raw data  
- ❌ **Cons**: Poor UX for non-technical users, hard to scale conversational BI

### Standalone Semantic Layer  
A dedicated platform (e.g., AtScale, Kyligence Zen, Cube.dev) between raw data and BI/AI tools.

- ✅ **Pros**: Central logic, GenAI-ready, cross-tool reuse, strong governance  
- ❌ **Cons**: Requires infrastructure and integration effort

### In-BI Tool Semantic Layer  
Embedded in a specific tool like Power BI datasets or LookML in Looker.

- ✅ **Pros**: Seamless UX, low setup friction  
- ❌ **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited cross-platform use

### 🔄 Architecture Comparison

| Approach               | Flexibility | Governance | Vendor Lock-In | GenAI Ready | End-User UX | Big Data Support |
|------------------------|-------------|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| In-Warehouse           | Low         | Strong     | None           | Low          | Poor          | High             |
| Standalone Layer       | High        | Strong     | None           | High         | Good          | High             |
| In-BI Tool             | Low         | Weak       | High           | Medium       | Excellent     | Limited          |







## How Leading Platforms Implement It

### Power BI (Microsoft)

Power BI uses **tabular semantic models**, which define relationships, hierarchies, calculated measures, and row-level security. These models are tightly integrated into Microsoft Fabric and Power BI Desktop, enabling:

- Centralized data modeling  
- Shared datasets across workspaces  
- Integration with **Copilot**, Microsoft’s GenAI assistant for NLQ and NLG  
- Alignment with enterprise governance frameworks  

Power BI’s semantic layer is mature, stable, and deeply embedded in Microsoft’s ecosystem — making it an ideal foundation for governed, enterprise-grade Generative BI.

### ThoughtSpot

While Power BI leads in market share and enterprise adoption, **ThoughtSpot is included here because it represents a GenAI-native approach to semantic modeling**. Its architecture was designed from the ground up for AI-first interaction, making it a forward-looking example of how semantic layers are evolving to support dynamic, conversational, and agent-driven analytics.

ThoughtSpot has built an **Agentic Semantic Layer** designed specifically for GenAI applications. Its key features include:

- **Synonym resolution** for flexible querying  
- **Contextual understanding** to refine and clarify user intent  
- **Data lineage and auditability** to trace back how each insight was generated  
- **LLM grounding** to ensure GenAI responses are aligned with trusted business logic

This layer powers **Spotter**, ThoughtSpot’s LLM-based assistant, enabling follow-up questions, conversational exploration, and smart narrative generation — all based on governed metrics and metadata.

ThoughtSpot’s approach reflects a shift from static models to **real-time, AI-native interaction**, positioning the semantic layer not just as a backend modeling tool but as a **dynamic interface between users and enterprise knowledge**.

:::{.callout-note title="Other Semantic Layer Platforms"}
 
Several modern platforms also support semantic modeling and may be part of a broader Gen BI architecture:

- **dbt Semantic Layer**  
- **AtScale**  
- **Cube.dev**  
- **LookML (Looker)**  

:::

## Summary

In the age of Generative BI, the semantic layer is no longer optional — it's foundational. Whether implemented as structured tabular models in Power BI or as dynamic, AI-augmented context layers in ThoughtSpot, the goal is the same:

To enable every user to ask questions in plain language and receive reliable, explainable answers rooted in trusted business logic.

A strong semantic layer unlocks the full potential of Generative BI — by combining the **ease of conversation** with the **rigor of governance**.

# Architecture and Technical Stack

The architecture of Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI) systems blends traditional BI components with modern AI capabilities, enabling intuitive, language-based interaction with enterprise data. Below, we outline the foundational components and their integration pathways.

## Core Components of Gen BI Architecture

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) are foundational to Gen BI, serving as the natural language engine that interprets user queries and generates responses.

- Understand plain-English prompts  
- Generate SQL or semantic queries  
- Create narratives and data summaries  
- Enable follow-up dialogue and clarifications

### Embeddings

Embeddings convert business concepts and user queries into vector space representations that LLMs and retrieval systems can understand.

- Used in semantic search  
- Support intent classification and prompt routing  
- Help match vague queries to structured metadata

### Prompt Routing and Orchestration

Routing logic determines which model, tool, or action handles a given user prompt.

- Classifies intent (e.g., NLQ, dashboard request, data explanation)  
- Chooses between query generation vs. content summarization  
- Enables agent-based chaining (e.g., “Generate chart → explain trend → suggest actions”)

### Agents and Planning Logic

Multi-step agents break complex questions into smaller tasks and chain them across tools.

- Ask clarifying questions  
- Execute queries and retrieve results  
- Formulate explanations or next-best actions

## NLQ/NLG Pipeline: How It Works

The NLQ (Natural Language Querying) and NLG (Natural Language Generation) workflow in Gen BI involves the following pipeline:

```text
User Prompt
   ↓
Intent Detection (NLQ vs NLG vs FAQ)
   ↓
Semantic Layer Query Mapping
   ↓
SQL or API Query Generation
   ↓
Execution on Data Platform (e.g., Snowflake)
   ↓
Result Interpretation & Summary Generation
   ↓
Optional Follow-up (via Agent)


> This modular pipeline enables systems to dynamically adapt to user needs while staying grounded in governed metrics and business logic.

## Integration with BI and Data Platforms

Modern Gen BI systems are not standalone — they embed into the existing BI and data ecosystem:

| Platform      | Role in Gen BI Stack                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power BI**  | Semantic model layer + Copilot for NLQ/NLG inside BI workflows      |
| **Tableau**   | NLQ interface (Ask Data), LLM integrations via Tableau GPT          |
| **Snowflake** | Execution engine; integrates with vector search, semantic cache     |
| **dbt**       | Transformation logic and semantic modeling; aligns with Gen BI via dbt metrics and dbt Semantic Layer (optional) |

> Gen BI tools use these platforms not only to execute queries but also to embed generative capabilities directly into dashboards, reports, and collaboration interfaces.

## Vector Databases and Retrieval Systems

Vector databases store and retrieve embeddings — a critical component for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational memory.

- Examples: **Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS**
- Use cases in Gen BI:
  - Storing previous Q&A history
  - Retrieving metric definitions or documentation
  - Enhancing query recall and follow-up interaction

> When used effectively, vector search improves both the accuracy and context-awareness of Gen BI assistants.

## Summary

Generative BI’s architecture extends beyond traditional BI. It merges **language intelligence (LLMs, embeddings, agents)** with **governed data access (semantic layers, BI tools)** — orchestrated via prompt routing and vector-based retrieval systems. The result is a system that enables users to interact with enterprise data in intuitive, adaptive, and explainable ways.
