# Executive Summary

## What is Generative BI?

Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI) integrates large language models (LLMs) into business intelligence workflows, enabling users to interact with data through natural language queries (NLQ) and generate dynamic narratives (NLG). This shift moves BI from static dashboards and pre-defined filters to real-time, conversational insight delivery.

Unlike traditional BI tools that require technical skill to extract insights, Gen BI allows users to ask questions in plain English, automates reporting, and generates personalized summaries — all grounded in enterprise data.

## Why Now?

Three converging trends are accelerating the adoption of Gen BI:

- **LLM Maturity**: Advanced models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini now support complex reasoning and multilingual interaction.
- **Technology Convergence**: Modern data stacks (e.g., Snowflake, dbt, Power BI) provide clean, governed data layers that LLMs can safely access.
- **Business Demand**: Organizations want faster, more intuitive access to insights without expanding BI teams.

According to Gartner, 40% of enterprise applications now include conversational AI, up from less than 5% in 2020<sup>[1]</sup>.

A 2024 McKinsey survey found that 65% of organizations use generative AI in at least one business function — nearly double the rate from the previous year<sup>[2]</sup>.

## Strategic Relevance for Our Organization

For data-driven organizations, Gen BI offers immediate strategic benefits:

- **Democratizes analytics**: Empowers non-technical users to access data independently
- **Automates narrative generation**: Saves analysts time with auto-generated summaries, KPI explanations, and board-ready briefs
- **Improves data literacy**: Translates structured data into business-friendly language
- **Boosts BI ROI**: Enhances the value of existing BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or ThoughtSpot without requiring replacement

McKinsey estimates that generative AI could contribute up to $4.4 trillion annually to global productivity gains<sup>[3]</sup>. Organizations that embed Gen BI early stand to gain a decisive advantage in decision velocity, efficiency, and user empowerment.

# Foundations of Generative BI  
- From Traditional BI to Generative BI  
- Key capabilities: NLQ, NLG, agent-based analysis  
- Difference from self-service BI and augmented analytics  

# Semantic Layer: The Bridge Between Data and Language  
- What is a semantic layer?  
- Mapping business terms to technical data  
- NLQ Enablement through semantic modeling  
- Tools and frameworks (dbt, AtScale, Power BI, etc.)  
- Governance, consistency, and reusability benefits  

# Current Gen BI Solutions: Landscape, Strengths, and Weaknesses  
- Overview of available solutions (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, Tableau GPT, ThoughtSpot Sage, Sisense AI, Qlik Staige)  
- Strengths: integration with existing tools, ease of use, vendor support, scalability  
- Weaknesses: limited context awareness, hallucination risk, lack of deep customization, hidden costs  
- Open-source vs. commercial platforms  
- Criteria to consider when evaluating solutions  

# Use Cases and Applications  
- Natural Language Querying (NLQ): Ad hoc question answering over enterprise data  
- Natural Language Generation (NLG): Dashboard summaries, KPI explanations, narratives  
- Use cases by function (Finance, Risk, Ops, Marketing, HR, etc.)  
- BI Copilots, GenAI chat interfaces, and report generation  

# Architecture and Technical Stack  
- LLMs, Embeddings, Prompt Routing, Agents  
- NLQ/NLG pipelines: how they work technically  
- Integration with BI tools: Power BI, Tableau, Snowflake, dbt  
- Vector databases and retrieval systems  

# Data Governance and Trust  
- Access control and permissioning  
- Preventing hallucinations and ensuring query accuracy  
- Traceability, auditability, and metadata integration  
- The role of the semantic layer and governed metrics  

# Responsible and Ethical Gen BI  
- Bias and fairness in language-based outputs  
- Transparency and explainability  
- Regulatory and compliance alignment  
- Human-in-the-loop safeguards and approval layers  

# Implementation Roadmap  
- Pilot selection and business value alignment  
- Building or adopting a semantic layer  
- Tool and model evaluation (LLMs, vector DBs, orchestration)  
- Phased rollout, training, and change management  

# ROI and Value Realization  
- Productivity and cost-efficiency gains  
- Time-to-insight acceleration  
- Impact on data culture and decision-making  
- Success metrics and adoption KPIs  

# Risks and Challenges  
- LLM limitations and hallucination risks  
- Data quality and inconsistency issues  
- Upskilling and adoption hurdles  
- Security, compliance, and vendor lock-in
