# Executive Summary  
- What is Generative BI?  
- Why now?  
- Strategic relevance for our organization  

# Foundations of Generative BI  
- From Traditional BI to Generative BI  
- Key capabilities: NLQ, NLG, agent-based analysis  
- Difference from self-service BI and augmented analytics  

# Semantic Layer: The Bridge Between Data and Language  
- What is a semantic layer?  
- Mapping business terms to technical data  
- NLQ Enablement through semantic modeling  
- Tools and frameworks (dbt, AtScale, Power BI, etc.)  
- Governance, consistency, and reusability benefits  

# Current Gen BI Solutions: Landscape, Strengths, and Weaknesses  
- Overview of available solutions (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, Tableau GPT, ThoughtSpot Sage, Sisense AI, Qlik Staige)  
- Strengths: integration with existing tools, ease of use, vendor support, scalability  
- Weaknesses: limited context awareness, hallucination risk, lack of deep customization, hidden costs  
- Open-source vs. commercial platforms  
- Criteria to consider when evaluating solutions  

# Use Cases and Applications  
- Natural Language Querying (NLQ): Ad hoc question answering over enterprise data  
- Natural Language Generation (NLG): Dashboard summaries, KPI explanations, narratives  
- Use cases by function (Finance, Risk, Ops, Marketing, HR, etc.)  
- BI Copilots, GenAI chat interfaces, and report generation  

# Architecture and Technical Stack  
- LLMs, Embeddings, Prompt Routing, Agents  
- NLQ/NLG pipelines: how they work technically  
- Integration with BI tools: Power BI, Tableau, Snowflake, dbt  
- Vector databases and retrieval systems  

# Data Governance and Trust  
- Access control and permissioning  
- Preventing hallucinations and ensuring query accuracy  
- Traceability, auditability, and metadata integration  
- The role of the semantic layer and governed metrics  

# Responsible and Ethical Gen BI  
- Bias and fairness in language-based outputs  
- Transparency and explainability  
- Regulatory and compliance alignment  
- Human-in-the-loop safeguards and approval layers  

# Implementation Roadmap  
- Pilot selection and business value alignment  
- Building or adopting a semantic layer  
- Tool and model evaluation (LLMs, vector DBs, orchestration)  
- Phased rollout, training, and change management  

# ROI and Value Realization  
- Productivity and cost-efficiency gains  
- Time-to-insight acceleration  
- Impact on data culture and decision-making  
- Success metrics and adoption KPIs  

# Risks and Challenges  
- LLM limitations and hallucination risks  
- Data quality and inconsistency issues  
- Upskilling and adoption hurdles  
- Security, compliance, and vendor lock-in
