## 📈 Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI)

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Generative BI transforms data consumption by allowing non-technical users to explore reports, uncover insights, and ask ad hoc questions using natural language — all without waiting on analysts. This boosts data literacy and speeds up decision-making across business units.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Microsoft Copilot in Power BI: Enables users to ask natural-language questions and instantly generate charts or summaries.  
- ThoughtSpot Sage: Combines search with GenAI to explain patterns and alert users to anomalies.  
- Internal Gen BI tools: Many banks are building custom assistants on top of Snowflake, BigQuery, or Lakehouse environments to support executive dashboards and ops reviews.
