## üìä Operational Efficiency

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Banks deal with vast volumes of reports, compliance documentation, and internal knowledge. Generative AI improves productivity by summarizing documents, automating workflows, and assisting developers ‚Äî freeing employees to focus on higher-value tasks and accelerating project delivery.
:::

## üîê Risk Management

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Fraud detection and risk modeling are core to banking safety. GenAI enhances traditional models by spotting subtle anomalies, synthesizing potential fraud scenarios, and enabling faster investigation of suspicious transactions.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Mastercard ‚Äì Decision Intelligence: Evaluates over 1 trillion data points in real time to approve 143+ billion transactions annually.  
- Wells Fargo ‚Äì AI for Fraud: Uses GenAI for enhanced anomaly detection in transactional data.

## üìù Credit Approval and Loan Underwriting

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Credit underwriting involves reviewing complex financial documents and assessing risk within tight timeframes. Generative AI helps automate the analysis of financial statements, legal documents, and industry benchmarks, enabling faster loan decisions, improved accuracy, and streamlined compliance.
:::

**Examples:**

:::

**Examples:**  
- JPMorgan Chase ‚Äì Hyper-personalized Campaigns: Uses GenAI to create individualized marketing materials.

## üìà Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI)

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Generative BI transforms data consumption by allowing non-technical users to explore reports, uncover insights, and ask ad hoc questions using natural language ‚Äî all without waiting on analysts. This boosts data literacy and speeds up decision-making across business units.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Microsoft Copilot in Power BI: Enables users to ask natural-language questions and instantly generate charts or summaries.  
- ThoughtSpot Sage: Combines search with GenAI to explain patterns and alert users to anomalies.  
- Internal Gen BI tools: Many banks are building custom assistants on top of Snowflake, BigQuery, or Lakehouse environments to support executive dashboards and ops reviews.

## üßæ Key Takeaways

- GenAI is no longer experimental in banking ‚Äî it's powering real customer-facing and internal systems.
- Use cases like customer engagement, underwriting, and Gen BI deliver measurable productivity and experience gains.
