## 🏦 Customer Engagement

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Generative AI enables banks to deliver faster, more intelligent, and more personalized customer service. By automating routine interactions and offering real-time assistance, banks can improve customer satisfaction, reduce support costs, and scale their service capabilities without increasing headcount.
:::

- Wells Fargo – Fargo: Supports English and Spanish to help customers manage cards and access banking services via natural language.  
- BNY Mellon – Eliza: Internal chatbot and tooling platform used by 52,000 employees to build GenAI-powered apps like lead generation tools.

## 📊 Operational Efficiency

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Banks deal with vast volumes of reports, compliance documentation, and internal knowledge. Generative AI improves productivity by summarizing documents, automating workflows, and assisting developers — freeing employees to focus on higher-value tasks and accelerating project delivery.
:::

- JPMorgan – LLM Suite: Automates document summarization, content creation, and reporting.  
- Morgan Stanley – AskResearchGPT: Provides natural language access to 70,000+ research reports.  
- PwC – Compliance Automation: Uses GenAI to summarize regulatory documents and extract clauses.  
- Citi – Reporting Automation: Streamlines compliance reporting and data extraction.  
- Citigroup – AI Tools for Developers: Boosts engineering productivity with GenAI code assistance.

## 🔐 Risk Management

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Fraud detection and risk modeling are core to banking safety. GenAI enhances traditional models by spotting subtle anomalies, synthesizing potential fraud scenarios, and enabling faster investigation of suspicious transactions.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Mastercard – Decision Intelligence: Evaluates over 1 trillion data points in real time to approve 143+ billion transactions annually.  
- Wells Fargo – AI for Fraud: Uses GenAI for enhanced anomaly detection in transactional data.

## 📝 Credit Approval and Loan Underwriting

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Credit underwriting involves reviewing complex financial documents and assessing risk within tight timeframes. Generative AI helps automate the analysis of financial statements, legal documents, and industry benchmarks, enabling faster loan decisions, improved accuracy, and streamlined compliance.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Moody’s Analytics – CreditLens: Automates credit memo creation and industry analysis with generative tools.  
- JPMorgan Chase – COiN Platform: Uses GenAI to analyze legal contracts in seconds, reducing loan underwriting time.

## 📣 Personalized Marketing

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Generative AI enables banks to move beyond mass marketing and deliver personalized, data-driven messaging. This improves customer engagement, increases conversion rates, and enhances long-term loyalty.
:::

**Examples:**  
- JPMorgan Chase – Hyper-personalized Campaigns: Uses GenAI to create individualized marketing materials.

## 📈 Generative Business Intelligence (Gen BI)

::: {.callout appearance="simple" title=""}
**Why it matters:**  
Generative BI transforms data consumption by allowing non-technical users to explore reports, uncover insights, and ask ad hoc questions using natural language — all without waiting on analysts. This boosts data literacy and speeds up decision-making across business units.
:::

**Examples:**  
- Microsoft Copilot in Power BI: Enables users to ask natural-language questions and instantly generate charts or summaries.  
- ThoughtSpot Sage: Combines search with GenAI to explain patterns and alert users to anomalies.  
- Internal Gen BI tools: Many banks are building custom assistants on top of Snowflake, BigQuery, or Lakehouse environments to support executive dashboards and ops reviews.

## 🧾 Key Takeaways

- GenAI is no longer experimental in banking — it's powering real customer-facing and internal systems.
- Use cases like customer engagement, underwriting, and Gen BI deliver measurable productivity and experience gains.
