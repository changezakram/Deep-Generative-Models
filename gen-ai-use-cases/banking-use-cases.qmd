## üîç Detailed Use Cases


### Fraud Detection

- **Problem**: Detecting rare, evolving fraud patterns is difficult with traditional rule-based systems.
- **Solution**: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and VAE-based anomaly detection are used to identify outlier transactions in real time.<sup>[1]<sup>
- **Impact**: +20% detection accuracy and ‚Äì85% false positives (Mastercard).<sup>[2]<sup>

### Credit Approval and Loan Underwriting

- **Problem**: Credit underwriting requires reviewing financial statements, legal documents, and industry data under time pressure ‚Äî a process that is slow, manual, and error-prone.  
- **Solution**: Generative AI accelerates underwriting by analyzing credit memos, extracting key risk metrics, and summarizing legal clauses, enabling faster and more consistent loan decisions.  
- **Impact**: JPMorgan COiN saved over 360,000 hours by automating legal reviews; Zest AI reduced underwriting time from days to minutes and increased approvals by up to 25% with no added risk.<sup>[3][4]</sup>

### Customer Engagement

- **Problem**: Call centers and support channels face high volumes of routine queries, long wait times, and rising operational costs.  
- **Solution**: Generative AI powers conversational agents that provide real-time, personalized support across multiple languages and channels, improving CX while reducing human workload.  
- **Impact**: Erica has handled 2B+ interactions with an average 44s resolution time; Cora+ reduced escalations by 50% and improved customer satisfaction by 150%. <sup>[5][6]</sup>

### Personalized Insights

- **Problem**: Financial advisors often struggle to provide timely, personalized advice due to information overload and manual follow-up tasks.
- **Solution**: Generative AI automates note-taking, analyzes client profiles and market trends, and generates tailored investment recommendations.
- **Impact**: Morgan Stanley‚Äôs *AI @ Morgan Stanley Debrief* saves ~30‚ÄØminutes per meeting, freeing up 10‚Äì15‚ÄØhours/week per advisor for higher-value interactions. <sup>[7][8]</sup>

### Generative BI

- **Problem**: Business leaders often struggle to extract timely insights from complex, multi-source data environments, relying on static dashboards or analysts.  
- **Solution**: Generative AI combines LLMs with backend analytical pipelines or generative models (e.g., VAE, Diffusion) to deliver real-time, conversational insights tailored to executive needs.  
- **Impact**: Power BI Copilot users save +1.2‚ÄØhours/week through automated summaries; ThoughtSpot achieves up to 95% accuracy in insights generated. <sup>[9][10]</sup>

### Document Generation

- **Problem**: Writing compliance memos, suspicious activity reports (SARs), and internal summaries requires significant manual effort and is prone to inconsistencies.  
- **Solution**: Generative AI models‚Äîparticularly LLMs and intelligent document processing (IDP) systems‚Äîautomate document classification, data extraction, summarization, and drafting, while supporting compliance standards.  
- **Impact**: AI-powered IDP platforms have reduced review time by up to 90%, improved processing accuracy, and enabled faster turnaround for compliance documents. <sup>[11][12][13]</sup>

### Document Summarization

- **Problem**: Manual summarization of research and compliance documents is time-consuming and error-prone.  
- **Solution**: GenAI tools powered by LLMs extract, synthesize, and summarize large volumes of internal content at scale.  
- **Impact**: Morgan Stanley‚Äôs AskResearchGPT summarizes insights from 70,000+ proprietary reports; EY‚Äôs DI Platform saves 90% review time, cuts costs by 80%, and improves accuracy by 25%.<sup>[14][15][16]</sup>

### Synthetic Data Generation

- **Problem**: Real data can't be shared freely due to privacy, regulatory, and operational constraints.  
- **Solution**: Use VAE, Diffusion, or GAN-based models to generate synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while protecting sensitive information.  
- **Impact**: JPMorgan uses synthetic data to develop and test AI models in secure environments; industry surveys highlight growing adoption of GANs and Diffusion for financial data simulation.<sup>[17][18]</sup>
