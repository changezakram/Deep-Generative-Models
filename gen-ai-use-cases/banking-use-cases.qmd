## Credit Approval and Loan Underwriting

**Why it matters:**  
Loan underwriting requires deep analysis of financial documents and regulatory text. Generative AI accelerates these reviews by extracting key details, drafting summaries, and helping credit officers make informed decisions more efficiently.

**Examples:**
