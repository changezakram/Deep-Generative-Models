Unlike traditional AI systems that classify or tag inputs, generative models **produce** new outputs based on patterns they’ve learned.\n\nSince 2022, innovation in this space has accelerated rapidly. Foundation models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are being deployed across industries — from writing assistance and image generation to fraud detection and synthetic data creation.\n\n> 💡 **Business impact:** McKinsey estimates that generative AI could contribute up to **$4.4 trillion in annual global economic value**, with wide-ranging implications for productivity, personalization, and decision support.\n\nAt the same time, generative AI introduces new risks. Outputs may appear convincing but be inaccurate, biased, or open to misuse. This is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as banking, healthcare, and law.  \nEnsuring responsible use requires strong governance, human oversight, and ethical deployment practices.\n\n\n## How Generative Models Work\n\nGenerative AI models aim to learn the underlying distribution of real-world data, typically denoted as $p_{\\text{data}}(x)$. Their goal is to approximate this distribution as closely as possible.\n\n\n- The distribution learned by the model is denoted as $p_\\theta(x)$  \n- We generate new data by **sampling** from this learned distribution  \n- In practice, generative models are trained to **maximize the expected log-likelihood** of $p_\\theta(x)$, or equivalently, **minimize the divergence** between $p_\\theta(x)$ and $p_{\\text{data}}(x)$\n\n\n> 📌 **Note**:  \n> - Models like **Autoregressive models** and **Normalizing Flows** directly maximize log-likelihood.  \n> - **VAEs** maximize a variational lower bound (ELBO) on log-likelihood.  \n> - **GANs** minimize the **Jensen-Shannon divergence** through adversarial training.  \n> - **Diffusion models** and **EBMs** use score matching or other divergence-minimizing techniques.\n\nThis site explores how different model families approach this goal — from Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to Diffusion Models — grounded in theory and real-world use.\n\n## Key Gen AI Model Families\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong> Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</strong></summary>\n\n- **Core Idea**: Encode input to a latent space and reconstruct it while optimizing a lower bound on likelihood (ELBO).\n- **Likelihood**: Approximate (variational lower bound).\n- **Sampling**: Fast — sample latent vector and decode.\n- **Use Cases**: Representation learning, image generation.\n- **Example Models**: β-VAE, Conditional VAE\n- [Go to VAE write-up →](vae.qmd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong> Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong></summary>\n\n- **Core Idea**: A generator and discriminator compete in a minimax game to produce realistic samples.\n- **Likelihood**: None (implicit model).\n- **Sampling**: Fast — sample latent vector and pass through generator.\n- **Use Cases**: High-quality image generation, style transfer.\n- **Example Models**: StyleGAN, CycleGAN\n- [Go to GAN write-up →]\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong> Autoregressive Models</strong></summary>\n\n- **Core Idea**: Factor the joint distribution as a product of conditional probabilities.\n- **Likelihood**: Exact.\n- **Sampling**: Slow — token-by-token generation.\n- **Use Cases**: Language modeling, code generation, time series.\n- **Example Models**: GPT, PixelRNN\n- [Go to Autoregressive Models →]\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong> Normalizing Flows</strong></summary>\n\n- **Core Idea**: Learn invertible transformations of latent variables using the change-of-variable formula.\n- **Likelihood**: Exact and tractable.\n- **Sampling**: Fast — sample from base distribution and invert.\n- **Use Cases**: Density estimation, latent space modeling.\n- **Example Models**: RealNVP, Glow\n- [Go to Flow Models →](flows.qmd)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong> Energy-Based Models (EBMs)</strong></summary>\n\n- **Core Idea**: Define an energy function over inputs;
