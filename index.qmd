### 2. Autoregressive Models
- Generate sequences element-by-element 
- Examples: PixelCNN, WaveNet

### 3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Adversarial training with generator/discriminator
- High-quality image generation

### 4. Normalizing Flows
- Invertible transformations for exact likelihood  
- Flexible density estimation
