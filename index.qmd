## Overview

This site explores the foundations and frontiers of deep generative models — from core mathematical principles to the architectures powering today’s most advanced AI systems.

It’s designed to document concepts clearly, walk through implementations step by step, and connect theory with real-world relevance. Topics range from early probabilistic frameworks to cutting-edge diffusion models driving breakthroughs in image, text, and multimodal generation.

## Key Model Families

### 1. [Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)](vae.qmd) 
- Probabilistic encoder–decoder architecture  
- Learns latent representations using Gaussian priors  

### 2. Autoregressive Models 
- Models sequences element-by-element (e.g., PixelCNN, WaveNet)  
- Strong in text, audio, and image generation with local dependencies  

### 3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Generator vs. discriminator adversarial training  
- Capable of generating highly realistic images  

### 4. [Normalizing Flows](flows.qmd) 
- Uses invertible transformations for exact likelihood  
- Flexible for density estimation in high dimensions  

### 5. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) 
- Learns unnormalized energy landscapes  
- Suitable for both discrete and continuous data  

### 6. Diffusion Models  
- Iterative denoising process  
- State-of-the-art in high-quality image generation
