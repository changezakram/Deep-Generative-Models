## Why Generative AI Matters

Generative AI models can create entirely new content — such as text, images, simulations, or code — by learning from existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that classify, tag, or score inputs, generative models **produce** new outputs based on patterns they've learned.

Since 2022, the pace of innovation in generative AI has accelerated rapidly. Foundation models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are being applied across industries — from writing assistance and image generation to fraud detection and synthetic data creation.

> 💡 **Business impact:** According to McKinsey, generative AI could add up to **$4.4 trillion in annual global economic value**, with significant implications for productivity, personalization, and decision support.

However, generative AI also introduces new challenges. Outputs can be wrong, biased, or easily misused — especially in high-stakes domains like banking, healthcare, and law. Ensuring responsible use requires robust governance, human oversight, and ethical deployment frameworks.


## Generative AI Models

Generative AI models aim to learn the underlying distribution of real-world data, typically denoted as $p_{\text{data}}(x)$. Their goal is to approximate this distribution as closely as possible.


- The distribution learned by the model is denoted as $p_\theta(x)$  
- We generate new data by **sampling** from this learned distribution  
- In practice, generative models are trained to **maximize the expected log-likelihood** of $p_\theta(x)$, or equivalently, **minimize the divergence** between $p_\theta(x)$ and $p_{\text{data}}(x)$


> 📌 **Note**:  
> - Models like **Autoregressive models** and **Normalizing Flows** directly maximize log-likelihood.  
> - **VAEs** maximize a variational lower bound (ELBO) on log-likelihood.  
> - **GANs** minimize the **Jensen-Shannon divergence** through adversarial training.  
> - **Diffusion models** and **EBMs** use score matching or other divergence-minimizing techniques.

This site explores how different model families approach this goal — from Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to Diffusion Models — grounded in theory and real-world use.
