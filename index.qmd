## Overview

Welcome to my deep generative models resource. This site covers:

## Key Model Families

### 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture
- Learn latent spaces with Gaussian distributions
- [Learn more about VAEs](vae.html)

### 2. Autoregressive Models
- Generate sequences element-by-element 
- Examples: PixelCNN, WaveNet

### 3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Adversarial training with generator/discriminator
- High-quality image generation

### 4. Normalizing Flows
- Invertible transformations for exact likelihood
- Flexible density estimation

### 5. Energy-Based Models (EBMs)
- Learn energy functions for data distribution
- Flexible for discrete/continuous data

### 6. Diffusion Models
- Iterative denoising process
- State-of-the-art image generation
