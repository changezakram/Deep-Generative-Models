## Key Model Families

<details>
<summary><strong>📦 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: Encode input to a latent space and reconstruct it while optimizing a lower bound on likelihood (ELBO).
- **Likelihood**: Approximate (variational lower bound).
- **Sampling**: Fast — sample latent vector \( z \sim p(z) \) and decode.
- **Use Cases**: Representation learning, image generation.

<details>
<summary><strong>🌀 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: A generator and discriminator compete in a minimax game to produce realistic samples.
- **Likelihood**: None (implicit model).
- **Sampling**: Fast — sample latent vector and pass through generator.
- **Use Cases**: High-quality image generation, style transfer.

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 Autoregressive Models</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: Factor the joint distribution as a product of conditional probabilities.
- **Likelihood**: Exact.
- **Sampling**: Slow — token-by-token generation.
- **Use Cases**: Language modeling, code generation, time series.
- [Go to Autoregressive Models →](autoregressive.qmd)

<details>
<summary><strong>🔁 Normalizing Flows</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: Learn invertible transformations of latent variables using the change-of-variable formula.
- **Likelihood**: Exact and tractable.
- **Sampling**: Fast — sample from base distribution and invert.
- **Use Cases**: Density estimation, latent space modeling.
- [Go to Flow Models →](flows.qmd)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌫️ Diffusion Models</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: Learn to reverse a gradual noise process via denoising.
- **Likelihood**: Approximate (via variational bound).
- **Sampling**: Slow — requires hundreds of reverse steps.
- **Use Cases**: High-resolution image and audio generation.
- [Go to Diffusion Models →](diffusion.qmd)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔥 Energy-Based Models (EBMs)</strong></summary>

- **Core Idea**: Define an energy function over inputs; lower energy = higher probability.
- **Likelihood**: Unnormalized (intractable partition function).
- **Sampling**: Very slow — requires MCMC or Langevin dynamics.
- **Use Cases**: Uncertainty modeling, compositional generation.
