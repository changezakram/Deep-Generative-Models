## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Traditional autoencoders learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space) and reconstruct it. However, they fall short in several areas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They lack \textbf{generative capabilities} â€” they cannot sample new data effectively.
    \item The \textbf{latent space is unstructured}, offering little control or interpretation.
    \item There is no \textbf{probabilistic modeling}, limiting uncertainty estimation.
\end{itemize}
